= Research
The research for this paper was done using many methods. 
For general information, I used many internet pages, like Wikipedia, various technical blogs and even online teaching material from few subjects held at the Technical University of Applied Research. The subjects in question were the already mentioned _Digital technology_ and _Design of digital systems 1_, which were regular curriculum for my study degree.

For more technical details included, I referred to the datasheets of the manufacturer, for example the datasheet of the Intel (f.k.a. Altera) Cyclone 5 FPGA SoC which I referenced many times in my presentation and will be referencing in this paper as well.

The scientific research was done using Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore for the papers regarding the same ground subject.

The use of LLM should also be mentioned. I used the Perplexity AI search engine with Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the underlying LLM to find more sources in form of internet pages or papers. 
A website with the name “LanguageTool” was used for review of the written text. All text is written by me, the website was used for correction of different types errors, like type and grammatical errors.
