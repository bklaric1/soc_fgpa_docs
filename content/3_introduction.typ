= Introduction
The title of this paper raises several fundamental questions for readers unfamiliar with the topic: 
- What is an FPGA? 
- What does the term SoC mean? 
- And how are these concepts combined? 
In this introduction, an initial overview of these concepts will be provided to establish the foundation for the discussion that follows, while the rest of the paper aims to answer these questions in depth.

The name FPGA stands for Field Programmable Gate Array. It is a type of integrated circuit (IC) which can be purposely reconfigured after manufacturing. As the name suggests, an FPGA consists of connected programmable logic blocks @fpga_wikipedia.

The SoC acronym stands for System on Chip, and it represents an integration of different computer system components in a single chip. These components typically include the most essential elements of a computer system, such as the CPU, system controller, memory controller and the peripherals @soc_wikipedia.

Integration of these two technologies in one IC combines the best of the both worlds, the software programmability of the SoC with the hardware flexibility of the FPGAs. The naming convention stays consistent, with the combined name being the union of the two: SoC FPGA. 

These technologies and their union will be examined in the following sections, including their architecture, operational principles, and practical applications. The aim of the paper is to provide a comprehensive understanding of both the individual areas and the main subject, the SoC FPGAs.
