= Motivation
This subject has been a point of my interest for some time now. I first took notice of the FPGA technology during "Digital technology" classes in second semester. A part of the subject was the practical work with a FPGA boards. This peeked my interest at the time, since working with logic gates was always facinating to me. I have had many more opportunities to work with FPGA boards since then, and I am currently working on a technical project based on a SoC FPGA board. 

The technology was always compelling to me and I have wanted for a long time to delve deeper in the core to learn about everything there is to know about the FPGA technology and incorporation of a integrated processor systems with the FPGA on a single chip. The seminar, with the presentation and this paper presented itself as a great way to dive deeper in the subject, with the proper motivation.  

= Research
The research for this paper was done using many different sources. For general information, I used many different internet pages, like Wikipedia, various technical blogs and even online teaching material from few subjects held at the Technical University of Applied Research. The subjects in question were the already mentioned "Digital technology" and "Design of digital systems 1", which were regular curicuulum for my study degree.

For more technical details included mostly in the examples, I refered to the datasheets from the manufacturer, for example the datasheet of the Intel (f.k.a. Altera) Cyclone 5 FPGA SoC which I referenced many times in my presentation and will be mentioning in this paper as well.

The scientific research was done using Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore for the papers regarding the same ground subject.

The use of LLM should also be mentioned. I used the Perplexitiy AI search engine with Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the underlying LLM to find more sources in form of internet pages or papers. 
A website with the name "Language Tool" was used for review of the written text. All text is written by me, the website was used for checking of different types of type and grammatical errors.
