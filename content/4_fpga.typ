In this chapter, the basics and architecure of FPGAs are examined in detail, thus providing a foundation for understanding their integration with SoC technology.

== Basics
As already mentioned in introduction, FPGAs are programmable ICs. They offer high hardware flexibility in form of posibility to customize the circuit it self, meaning the strucutre of the circuit can be changed after manufacturing at any time through programming. 

First FPGA was developed in 1985 by the company Xilinx (which was later aquired by AMD). The developed FPGA, XC2064, had only 64 configurable logic blocks. Few other companies joined the development of FPGAs as well, most notably Altera and Actel (now Microchip). By 2013, these three companies held 77% of the FPGA market @fpga_wikipedia.

The FPGAs consist of three main componentes:
- configurable logic blocks (CLBs),
- programmable interconnects,
- I/O blocks.

These components form the building blocks for implementing virtually any logic circuit that a user can design.


The funcionality of the FPGAs is further extended through the use of IPs (Intellectual Properties), which provide pre-designed modules for various applications.

IPs sind vielfach einsetzbarer, vorgefertigter Funktionsblock, die von einem Entwickler oder Hersteller umgesetzt sind und werden dann so weiter lizenziert/verkauft
Speicherblöcke, zum Beispiel M4K RAM Blöcke
