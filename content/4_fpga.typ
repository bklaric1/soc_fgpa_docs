= FPGA

In this chapter, the basics and architecure of FPGAs are examined in detail, thus providing a foundation for understanding their integration with SoC technology.

== Basics

As already mentioned in introduction, FPGAs are programmable ICs. They offer high hardware flexibility in form of posibility to customize the circuit it self, meaning the strucutre of the circuit can be changed after manufacturing at any time through programming. 




First FPGA was developed in 1985 by the company Xilinx (which was later aquired by AMD). It had only 64 configurable logic blocks.
